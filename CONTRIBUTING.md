## Architecture Overview
Monostack follows a clean architecture pattern:
- `cmd/`: Entry point of the application.
- `internal/domain`: Core entities and logic.
- `internal/usecase`: Business logic and orchestration.
- `internal/adapters`: External interfaces (TUI using Bubble Tea, AWS SDK).
- `internal/pkg`: Shared utilities and UI styles.

## Coding Standards
